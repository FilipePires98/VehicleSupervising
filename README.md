## Description

The goal of this project is to provide a system focused on a platform that collects and processes information from simulated vehicles.
The programming tools used are: Java for the application; Apache Kafka for the messaging system; Java Swing for the graphical interfaces.

There are four entities: Collect, Report, Batch and Alarm.
Each entity has its own main method and is held accountable for a set of responsibilities around three kafka topics.
